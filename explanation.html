        <h2>Maze</h2>
        <p>A maze is a path or collection of paths, typically from an entrance to a goal. The word is used to 
            refer both to branching tour puzzles through which the solver must find a route, and to simpler 
            non-branching ("unicursal") patterns that lead unambiguously through a convoluted layout to a goal. 
           The pathways and walls in a maze are typically fixed, but puzzles in which the walls
           and paths can change during the game are also categorised as mazes or tour puzzles.

    <h2>Generation</h2>
    <p> A maze can be generated by starting with a predetermined arrangement of cells (most commonly 
        a rectangular grid but other arrangements are possible with wall sites between them. 
        This predetermined arrangement can be considered as a connected graph with the edges representing
        possible wall sites and the nodes representing cells. The purpose of the maze generation algorithm 
        can then be considered to be making a subgraph in which it is challenging to find a route between
        two particular nodes.</p>

<div class = "content" id ="algorithm">
    <h2>Randomized depth-first search</h2>
    <p>This algorithm, also known as the "recursive backtracker" algorithm, is a randomized version of the 
        depth-first search algorithm.Frequently implemented with a stack, this approach is one of the simplest 
        ways to generate a maze using a computer.Starting from a random cell, the computer then selects a 
        random neighbouring cell that has not yet been visited. The computer removes the wall between 
        the two cells and marks the new cell as visited, and adds it to the stack to facilitate backtracking. 
        The computer continues this process, with a cell that has no unvisited neighbours being considered a dead-end.
        When at a dead-end it backtracks through the path until it reaches a cell with an unvisited neighbour, 
        continuing the path generation by visiting this new, unvisited cell (creating a new junction).
        This process continues until every cell has been visited, causing the computer to backtrack all the 
        way back to the beginning cell.We can be sure every cell is visited.</p>
